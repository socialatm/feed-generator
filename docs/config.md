Config Type Definition (src\config.ts)

This code defines a TypeScript type called Config that acts as a blueprint for configuration settings in the application. Think of it like a template that specifies what information is needed to properly set up and run the program.

The Config type doesn't take any inputs or produce outputs directly - instead, it defines the structure that configuration data must follow. It's similar to creating a form where you specify what fields need to be filled out.

The configuration includes several important settings:

port: A number that specifies which network port the application should use
listenhost: A string that defines which network address to listen on
hostname: A string for the server's host name
sqliteLocation: A string indicating where the SQLite database file is stored
subscriptionEndpoint: A string for the endpoint where subscriptions are handled
serviceDid: A string representing the service's decentralized identifier
publisherDid: A string for the publisher's decentralized identifier
subscriptionReconnectDelay: A number specifying how long to wait before reconnecting if a subscription drops
The purpose of this code is to ensure that when someone creates configuration settings for the application, they include all these required pieces of information with the correct data types. It's like having a checklist that makes sure nothing important is forgotten when setting up the application.

This type definition helps catch errors early by making TypeScript verify that any configuration object used in the application has all these required properties with the correct types. If someone tries to create a configuration object missing any of these fields or using wrong data types (like putting a string where a number should be), TypeScript will show an error.
