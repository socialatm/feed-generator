"What's ALF" Feed Handler (whats-alf.ts)

This code creates a feed handler that retrieves and returns a list of posts in chronological order. Think of it like loading a social media timeline, where you see the newest posts first.

The code takes two inputs: a context object (ctx) that contains a database connection, and parameters (params) that specify how many posts to fetch and where to start from in the timeline (using a cursor).

The output is an object containing two things: a list of posts (feed) and a cursor that helps load the next batch of posts later (like turning to the next page in a book).

Here's how it works:

It starts by creating a database query that selects all posts, ordering them by their timestamp (indexedAt) and ID (cid) in descending order (newest first)
If there's a cursor parameter (meaning we're loading a continuation of posts), it converts the cursor timestamp and only selects posts older than that time
After getting the posts from the database, it transforms each post into a simpler format, keeping just the post's URI (unique identifier)
Finally, it creates a new cursor based on the timestamp of the last post in the results
The main data transformation happening is converting database rows into a feed format, where each post is represented by its URI. The cursor system is clever - it uses timestamps converted to strings to keep track of where to continue loading posts from, similar to how you might use a bookmark to remember where you left off in a book.

This code is part of a larger system and focuses specifically on the core logic of retrieving and formatting posts for a feed, making sure they're in the right order and properly paginated for efficient loading.
